\title{Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression for supervised dimension reduction.}
\usage{
supervised_pls(omx_data, y, num_btwn_pcs = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{omx_data}{A data.frames or matrices representing different regions.}

\item{y}{A numeric or factor vector representing the target variable.}

\item{num_btwn_pcs}{Number of principal components to use for between region variability.}
}
\value{
A matrix of latent supervised scores.
}
\description{
This function performs supervised dimension reduction using PLS regression to
find components that capture the covariance between the omics data and the
target variable. The resulting components can be used as meta features for
the meta adversarial model in \code{h_arf}.
